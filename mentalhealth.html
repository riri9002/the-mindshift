    <p style="width: 1000px;margin-left: 215px;">When you have anxiety, generally, you feel uneasy, scared and restless. Sweating, being tense and having an unnaturally quick heartbeat are all common symptoms of this. Generally, in stressful situations, anxiety can act up, such as moments before a test, or a submission.</p>
    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p style="width: 1000px;margin-left: 215px">There are not many known causes of these disorders, however, it is commonly assumed that the patient's brain chemistry, genetics and daily stress levels are huge contributors. </p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>

    <h3>Cures and Treatment Plans</h3>
    <p style="width: 1000px;margin-left: 215px">
        Some of the major treatment plans for Anxiety are psychotherapy and medications. Psycotherapy is when you talk to a professional in the therapy field about anything that has been troubling you. This is generally good for the patient, as it can help them by showing different thought patterns and emotional behaviours. However, anti-anxiety medications also exist, and are prescribed by physicians incase of a severe case. They may also prescribe you multiple different ones in the begining to see which would fit you the best.

        <p style="width: 1000px;margin-left: 215px;">Depression is a very prominent and serious problem within teenagers in recent times. It can usually be identified by the prolonged feelings of sadness and distress, and loss of interest, all of which can greatly impact their time at both school, and in their everyday lives.</p>
    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p style="width: 1000px;margin-left: 215px">There are countless contributing factors to depression, including, but not limited to tough life events, physical inactivity, smoking or usage of alcohol, and traumatic events.</p>

    </ul>
    <h3>Cures and Treatment Plans</h3>
    <p style="width: 1000px;margin-left: 215px">
    There are many physiological and medical cures for depression. However, your healthcare-provider will not give you the medications at first, opting for the physiological methods initally. This is because anti-depressants can have adverse side effects, or may not be needed in that certain situation. When taling about physiological methods, talk therapy is an important and possibly the most effective way. It allows the patient to talk about their mental state, and anything and everything which may be bothering them. It can usually be done in physically or virtually.

    <img src="schizimg.png" style="width: 300px; height: 300px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
        <p style="width: 1000px;margin-left: 215px;">Schizophrenia is a common mental health disorder, which millions of people suffer from yearly. It often involves the patient hallucinating and believing things that are not real frequently, and often being delusional. Let us find out more about this disease!</p>
    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p style="width: 1000px;margin-left: 215px"> In most cases, schizophrenia is caused because of a huge imbalance in the signals of the brain, which are used for communcation between two or more cells. Also, there could be broken or lack of connections between various parts of the brain.  </p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul style="margin-left: 215px;align-content:space-between;width:1000px;margin:auto;">
        <li style=" font-family: Inter; font-size: 20px">Unusually slower movements </li>

        Sadly, schizophrenia is not curable. However, it can be treated and helped. It is only a very small percent of all patients that actually recover from this. Generally, for schizophrenia, physicians prescribe medications. While talk therapy is beneficial and recommended, medicines are more efficient.

    <h2 id="OCD">Obsessive compulsive <br> disorder (OCD)</h2>
    <img src="ODCimg.png" style="width: 300px; height: 300px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
     <p style="width: 1000px;margin-left: 215px;">OCD is a common mental health disorder that affects people of all ages, including teenagers. It is characterized by unwanted, recurring thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) that individuals feel driven to perform. [ChatGPT]</p>
    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p style="width: 1000px;margin-left: 215px">OCD can develop due to a combination of genetic, neurological, behavioral, cognitive, and environmental factors. Stressful life events, imbalances in brain chemistry, and a family history of OCD may increase the likelihood of developing this disorder. [ChatGPT]</p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul style="margin-left: 215px;align-content:space-between;width:1000px;margin:auto;">
        <li style=" font-family: Inter; font-size: 20px">Unwanted repetitive thoughts</li> 
        <li style=" font-family: Inter; font-size: 20px">Compulsive behaviors</li> 
        <li style=" font-family: Inter; font-size: 20px">Fear of contamination or germs</li> 
        <li style=" font-family: Inter; font-size: 20px">Need for order and symmetry</li> 
        <li style=" font-family: Inter; font-size: 20px">Excessive checking or counting</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Cures and Treatment Plans</h3>
    <p style="width: 1000px;margin-left: 215px">
    Treatment for OCD typically involves therapy, medication, or a combination of both. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly exposure and response prevention (ERP), is one of the most effective methods. This therapy helps individuals confront their fears and reduce compulsive behaviors. Antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can also help regulate brain chemistry. Medication is usually considered if therapy alone is insufficient. [ChatGPT]

    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p style="width: 1000px;margin-left: 215px">ADHD is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Differences in brain structure and function, prenatal exposure to substances like tobacco or alcohol, and premature birth may contribute to its development. [ChatGPT]</p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul style="margin-left: 215px;align-content:space-between;width:1000px;margin:auto;">

    Treatment for ADHD often includes behavioral therapy, medication, or both. Behavioral therapy focuses on improving self-control, organization, and social skills. Stimulant medications like methylphenidate and amphetamines are commonly prescribed to help manage symptoms by increasing dopamine levels in the brain. Non-stimulant options are also available for individuals who may not respond well to stimulants. [ChatGPT]

    </ul>
    <h3>Cures and Treatment Plans</h3>
    <p style="width: 1000px;margin-left: 215px">
    PTSD treatment typically involves therapy, medication, or both. Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) helps individuals process and reframe traumatic memories. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is another effective therapy that uses guided eye movements to reduce the emotional impact of trauma. Antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications can help manage symptoms like anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. [ChatGPT]
