<div class=header><h1>Managing Stress <br>& Anxiety</h1></div>
    
    <br>
    <div style="align-content:space-between;width:1000px;margin:auto;"><p>Life in these last few years of our education can be extremely difficult. With pressure and stress from multiple different areas such as exams, school, peers and social media, it is super easy to lose focus and become overwhelmed but, luckily for you, there are ways to manage and control your anxiety before it controls you! Let's look into some foolproof ways to manage this stress and regain focus. </p></div>

        <h3>Exercise</h3>
    <p>Since we have all that frustration and stress built up in us, releasing it in the right way is essential. And what better way to do it than exercising?</p>      
    <div style="align-items: center;padding-left: 50px; font-family: Inter">
    <div class="tooltip">Hover for more info! <span class="tooltiptext">By working out for at least 30 minutes daily, you can make such a huge difference to your mental health! It makes your brain releases chemicals like endorphins and serotonin, which improve your mood and improve your mood for the next 12 hours! It also helps by taking your mind off of all those negative thoughts you may get, often stopping your brain from spiralling! <br><br> And yes, I know that for some people it may seem daunting at first, because if I am being honest, I am also not a huge fan of exercising. But start by taking baby steps. Literally. Use a step-tracker or smart watch and set daily step goals and make it your mission to reach them. Start with something small like 1000 daily and increase it over time. But always remember, slow progress is better than no progress!

        <h3>Journalling</h3>
    <p>By writing about your causes of stress in your life, your brain can sort through the problems and truly understand if what you are worried about is reasonable or not!</p>      
        <div style="align-items: center;padding-left: 50px; font-family: Inter">
        <div class="tooltip">Hover for more info! <span class="tooltiptext">Has anyone ever told you to pen down your thoughts? Well, this is just that! Journalling can help you process your thoughts and feelings, while getting rid of one of the biggest causers of mental health issues. Spiralling. It also promotes positive thoughts and allows you to look at the situation from a less negative perspective. Like I said before, it can allow you to review your thoughts and organise them, which can help reflect on them in an effective and positive mindset. <br> <br> It may feel scary at first to some, because I get it, writing down your thoughts, on a piece of paper, where anyone can read it, is scary. But you can also do it on your phone. Just take 2 minutes before going to bed to journal. Small steps like that can make a world of a difference.

        <h3>Mindfulness</h3>
    <p>Mindfulness  is an ancient practice, which helps calm the human brain down. It gives it more time to process information and make logical decisions!</p>      
        <div style="align-items: center;padding-left: 50px; font-family: Inter">
        <div class="tooltip tooltip-left">Hover for more info! <span class="tooltiptext">Mindfulness is an ancient practice, which was introduced by the Hindu culture over 4000 years ago. To be mindful, means to pay attention in the present moment. With our ever so busy lives right now, it can often be difficult, and people can forget to pay attention to their thoughts and feelings. The most wonderful thing about it, however, is the fact that everyone can practise this, and reap its rewards. <br> <br> It has many positive effects such as calming the mind, and it only takes a minute. First, you start by taking deep breaths. Observing how your lungs expand and contract. Focusing on the feeling of air travelling up and down your respiratory tract.

        <div class="tooltip">Hover for more info! <span class="tooltiptext">Looking after yourself is important given the busy and long hours spent on projects and deadlines. It can be anything you do to stay happy physically, mentally, and emotionally. It can be a distant or forgotten concept. However, there are some insanely good rewards that you get, such as a huge amount of melatonin, which helps lift your mood. <br> <br> Some ways you can do this are taking 5 minutes out of your day, and scheduling an activity that makes you happy, to relive your mind from the pressures and struggles of your daily life. But, remember to set boundaries, as too much can lead to a decline in productivity, effecting your performance at school.
